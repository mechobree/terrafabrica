# Terra Fabrica
(Todo: Come up with a better name)

You awake from a few million years long slumber to find yourself on the planet you once knew, clean from human interference, like they were never there.

 

You start from the stone age, with only sticks and stones, work your way up to copper & bronze, then iron which can kick-start kinetic mechanics with Create. From then on you work to steel which leads to electrical power. From then on, it's a continual tech ladder!

If that all sounds confusing, don't worry, there are guide books and a quest book to guide you through the mods & progression.

 

The mods being the largest of focus are TerraFirmaCraft, Create, Immersive Engineering, Mekanism & Pneumaticraft. These are the main mods that you will be working with throughout the lifetime of this pack, along with some custom machines from Custom Machinery.

 

The main end goal is to harness interstellar travel! (Which is not available atm)

 

This pack is essentially a spiritual successor to Per Fabrica Ad Astra, as it shares/gains inspiration from a lot of recipes & progression.
